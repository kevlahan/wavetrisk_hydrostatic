WAVETRISK Atmosphere and Ocean Adaptive Global Climate Model

A dynamically adaptive wavelet-based experimental climate model that provides global three-dimensional atmosphere or ocean models.  
`WAVETRISK` solves the multilayer shallow water equations with Lagrangian vertical coordinates in Boussinesq form using a mimetic 
method similar to that of `DYNAMICO`. Local horizontal grid resolution is adapted dynamically at each time 
step using a multilevel wavelet-based method, providing very high local grid refinement that tracks dynamically important structures.
The code is parallelized using mpi and scales well to at least <code>O(10<sup>3</sup>)</code> cores.

See the wiki `Users_manual.md` for more detailed information on the code, its approximation, models and instructions for compiling and running `WAVETRISK`.
