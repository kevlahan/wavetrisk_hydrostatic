WAVETRISK Atmosphere and Ocean Adaptive Climate Model

A dynamically adaptive wavelet-based experimental climate model that provides global three-dimensional atmosphere and ocean models.  
`WAVETRISK` solves multilayer shallow water equations with a Lagrangian vertical coordinates Boussinesq form using a mimetic 
method similar to that of `DYNAMICO`. Local horizontal grid resolution is adapted dynamically at each time 
step using a multilevel wavelet-based method, providing very high local grid refinement that tracks dynamically important structures.

See the `Wiki` `Home` for more information on the code, and instructions for compiling and running `WAVETRISK`.
